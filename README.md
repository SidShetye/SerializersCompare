SerializersCompare
==================
Showcasing a few C# text and binary serializers for performance and size. Similar in concept (but not internal design) to https://github.com/eishay/jvm-serializers/wiki but for C# instead of Java. Feel free to improve and send your pull request to me.

Notes
-----
1. The `cheating` tags above simply mean that unlike most serializers, Thrift/Avro code-gen their own data classes and those, not the application's existing classes, are used in transport and RPC. Most real world projects will therefore see extra processing time to copy values from their internal app logic classes into the Thrift/Avro auto-gen'd classes. In contrast, most other serializers (including Avro MSFT) use the app logic classes directly, bypassing the extra copy into the code-gen'd classes. So "cheating" simply means discarding that extra copy time. For real world performance indicators, you should look at figures WITHOUT cheating.

2. The Avro MSFT output is larger because the automatic schema generated by the MSFT version names each field nullable/optional while the handwritten one doesn't make them optional. This saves one byte per field (optional fields take 1 extra byte). If in doubt, one can confirm the same sizes and bitstream by using InheritedEntityAvroWithNulls.avsc in the code-gen phase.
